            How to use: Navigate to your networks page on LinkedIn and the extension will automatically add connections.
            <br>
            AddAll does not add all possible connections, but all that load within 2 seconds of the webpage fully loading.
            <br>
            AddAll does not send follow requests to organizations or influencers.
